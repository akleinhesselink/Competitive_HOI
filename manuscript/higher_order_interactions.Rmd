Abstract
--------

In most classical models of species competition, the outcome of competition is determined by fixed pairwise competition coefficients.  

However, almost every community on earth contains many more than two species, and almost every species interacts with more than one other competitor. 

It cannot be assumed a priori that models based upon only pairwise per capita competition adequately describe multi-species communities.   

Specifically, higher order interactions (HOI) complicate the use of pairwise competition coefficients for any community with three or more species. 

HOIs occur when pairwise competition coefficients are not fixed and instead depend on the density of other species in the community. 

The question of when and where HOIs occur is thus critical to extending the insights derived from two species models to natural communities.

In this paper we examine how and when HOIs emerge in simple competition models when more than two species compete. 

We break the origin of HOI's into cases where they emerge due to changes in instantaneous interaction coefficients, and cases where they result from changes in species densities or sizes that are not captured in the model structure. 

We conclude that HOI's may be more likely to arise when species densities are away from equilibrium and for interactions between species with longer life cycles.

Clarifying the source of HOI helps us better understand the true nature of competition and the stability of multispecies communities. 


*Key words: competition, coexistence theory*

Introduction
-------------

Almost every species on earth interacts with a vast number of predators, pathogens and competitors. And the densities of each of these species, are themselves determined by interactions with yet other species in the community. Nonetheless, most classical models in community ecology summarise species interactions with fixed pairwise interaction coeficients. In particular, pairwise competition coefficients have been critical to the development of modern coexistence theory (MCT). A powerful implication arising from the assumption of fixed pairwise competition coefficients is that the outcome of multi-species species competition can be predicted by measuring the outcome of competition between all pairs of species in that community (cite). This assumptions leads to the idea that a general theory of species competitive exclusion and coexistence can be achieved if one could simply map pairwise differences in species' traits and physiology to species pairwise competition coefficients [@kraft_plant_2015; @adler_trait-based_2013]. 

The possibility of higher order interactions (HOIs) between species challenges the core assumption of pairwise competition coefficients.  By definition, HOIs mean that pairwise competition coefficients are not themselves fixed, but depend upon the densities of other species in the community. Among other issues that arise in a world of HOIs are classical definitions of coexistence and the niche which rely upon comparing pairwise intraspecific competition coefficients to interspecific competition coefficients (Chesson, etc. etc.).  If HOIs are common, then predicting community assembly in natural multi-species communities might not be achieved by measuring all possible pairwise competitive interactions. Thus, a thorough empirical and theoretical investigation of HOI in natural communities is critical to expanding ecological beyond two species models and increasing its relevance in the natural world.  

#### Defining higher order interactions 

Despite the potential importance of HOIs in a multi-species world, competitive HOIs have received relatively little theoretical or empirical attention. This extends even to the matter of defining what they are.  

To even begin discussing HOIs, we need to first define competition.  We approach the definition from a mechanistic perspective first and then a phenomenological perspective.  From a mechanistic perspective, competition occurs when individuals consume the same limiting resources. Increases in consumer densities change the availability of resources which then changes the growth rate of consumers. Thus at its most basic resource competition can be thought of as an indirect effect between individuals mediated by resource concentration (fig 1). Equivalent models apply to any limiting environmental factors, such as shared mutualists and shared predators and pathogens (apparent competition).  

In contrast, the phenomenological definition of competition dispenses with external environmental factors such as resource concentration and instead focuses on the indirect effects themselves. Phenomenological competition is measured by the reduction in a per-capita population growth rate due to an increase in density of individuals of the same trophic level (cite). This perspective on competition is extremely powerful because it includes all shared resources and other environmental feedbacks into one effect that can be measured empirically. A phenomenological definition of competition also encompasses direct interactions between individuals of the same trophic level, such as hemiparisitism, intra-guild predation, interference competition and allelopathy. 

We contrast mechanistic and phenomenological approaches to competition because they have fundamentally different implications for HOIs. In a mechanistic model, it is quite hard to even define HOIs.  If one knows the resource consumption rates of each species, and the value of those resources to each species' population growth rate, then you can calculate the indirect effect of each species on each other and the stability and trajectory of multi-species communities. HOIs are a non-issue because they are implicit in the model. 

However, in a phenomenological model, the structure and stability of the community depends on the effects of species densities on other species population growth rates and in this case HOIs have a clear definition. In figure 2, competitive effects are depicted as arrows showing that density of species 2 reduces the vital rate of species 1 by some factor $\alpha_{12}$. The dashed arrow shows that species 3 modifies the competitive effect of species 2 on 1. We take this kind of interaction modification to be an HOI, specifically a second order competitive interaction.  More generally, pairwise interactions occur when the effect of species $j$ on species $i$ depends only on the density of species $j$ and HOIs occur whenever the effect of species $j$ on species $i$ depends also on the density of any other species than $j$.    

\begin{figure}[!ht]

      \includegraphics[width=6in]{../figures/HOI_1.png}
  \caption{}
  \label{fig:comp_network}
\end{figure}

As further illustration of our definition of HOIs we start with a general model for species phenomenological competition,   

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
n_{i,t+1} = n_{i,t}f(C), 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $n_{i,t}$ is the density of species $i$ at time $t$, $f$ is a function that gives the per capita population growth rate as a function of total competition experienced $C_i$. Competition between species $i$, $j$ and $k$ is pairwise and does not involve HOIs if each species contributes linearly to competition such that $C = \sum\alpha_{i,j}(n_j)$, where $\alpha_{i,j}$ is a function of competitor density $n_j$. In contrast, HOIs occur whenever overall competition $C$ cannot be broken down into additive pairwise components. 

Consider defining the competition experienced by species 1 as: $C_1(n_1,n_2,n_3) = (\alpha_{1,1}n_{1} + \alpha_{1,2}n_{2} + \alpha_{1,3}n_3)$.  If we relax the assumption that pairwise competition coefficients are fixed and instead allow the competition coefficients to depend on other competitor densities, our model now includes the possibility of HOIs.  Replace $\alpha_{1,2}$ with a linear function of $n_3$, $a(n_3) = \alpha_{1,2} + \beta n_3$. Now the competitive effect of $n_{2}$ on $n_{1}$ depends on $n_3$. The equation for competition can be re-written as, $C_1 = (\alpha_{1,1}n_{1} + \alpha_{1,2}n_{2} + \beta n_{2}n_{3} + \alpha_{1,3}n_{3})$.

In this example, $\beta$ captures a second order HOI effect of species $2$ and $3$ together. As long as $\beta \neq 0$ we can no longer isolate the pairwise effect of species $2$ or $3$ on species $1$. In general, more diverse communities allow for HOIs of greater order, with a community of $s$ species having HOIs of the order $s-1$ possible. From an empirical perspective, the presence of HOIs means that if we measure the per capita population growth rate of each focal species $i$ when it is rare ($n_i \approx 0$), and we vary the density of each of the competitors (including $i$ itself), this will not be enough to predict the dynamics in a three, or even a two species community! 

Now that we have defined HOIs, we explore a variety of mechanistic and phenomenological models in order to try and classify the origin of HOIs.  Finally we evaluate whether any of the examples are likely to generate HOIs in nature. 

#### HOIs arrising from sequences of pairwise competition

HOIs could arise in discrete time models when the time step involves aggregating of a sequence of pairwise competition events. In a recent theoretical analysis, Grilli et al. (2017) provided a concise demonstration of this effect.  In their model, seedling trees compete to fill a forest gap.  If competition for the gap occurs as a sequence of competitive rounds between pairs of individuals then HOIs naturally emerge.  This counterintuitive result occurs because the probability that a species wins the gap depends not only on its direct pairwise interactions, but also on the pairwise interactions between its competitors. In effect, which competitor the species interacts with in round two of the tournament depends on those competitors interactions in round one. Because of these indirect effects, we cannot express the gap filling tournament with a single set of pairwise competition coefficients, we need to include HOIs in the model.

In the Grilli model, competition involved a tournament of discrete winner-take-all competitive events. The idea of having plant competition occur one at a time may perhaps seem unrealistic. However, their model captures a general process that could apply to many types of models. As another example we consider an annual plant population that follows a two stage model. Seeds germinate and survive into adults with probability $p$: $a = n_{t}p$, where $a$ is adult density at an intermediate time within the growing season, and $n_{t}$ is the initial seed density at the time $t$. After that, adults produce the next generation of seeds via a fecundity rate $f$: $n_{t+1} = af$. Because the plants are annuals there is no adult survival. 

We can introduce competition by making fecundity of species $i$ a function of adult density of all species in the community: $f_i = f_i(a_i, a_j)$.  Seedling germination and survival could also be function of competition, so we could make $p_i$ a function of initial seed density such that $p_i = p_i(n_i, n_j)$. 

Now we consider a two species community with initial seed densities for species one and two of $n_1$ and $n_2$ and calculate the per capita seed production of species 1 over the time step $t$ to $t+1$,  

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq2}
\begin{split}
\frac{n_{1,t+1}}{n_{1,t}} = p_1( n_{1,t}, n_{2,t} )f_1( a_{1,u}, a_{2,u} ) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In the model above, adult density is an intermediate state variable that is both the product of competition during the first part of the growing season but also contributes to competition during the reproductive phase. 

Re-writing to eliminate the intermediate phase, 

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq3}
\begin{split}
\frac{n_{1,t+1}}{n_{1,t}} = p_1( n_{1,t}, n_{2,t} )f_1( n_{1,t}p_1( n_{1,t}, n_{2,t} ), n_{2,t}p_2( n_{1,t}, n_{2,t} ) ) 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

This equation shows that the effect of $2$ on $1$ cannot be fully captured by pairwise effects of two on one because it will also depend on the initial density of one and how strongly one reduces the survival of two. This is apparent when considering that the fecundity function $f_i$ will change depending on the density of both competitors.  

Aggregating the survival and reproduction phases of the lifecycle and the competitive effects on each, results in a quite complicated equation involving numerous polynomial terms of $n_{1,t}$ and $n_{2,t}$ including their product.  

One way of interpreting the above model is to consider it a case where there is a distinct survival niche and a distinct fecundity niche.  The survival niche is encoded by the matrix $\alpha_ij$ whereas the fecundity niche is encoded by $\beta_ij$. Most plant populations encompass some kind of stage structure and it seems likely that competitive effects between individuals probably vary depending on the stage structure.  

*I'd like to do some more work on this.  I think having an example where we show how HOIs emerge analytically. Specifically if we could show analytically how the two stages of competition given by the $\alpha$ and $\beta$ in a two stage lifecycle model contribute to HOIs that would be really useful.  My hunch is that HOI terms cancel out in some circumstances which is why we can successfully model populations without HOI terms in a lot of cases.  The problem is that the expression for HOIs will depend very much on how we account for competition in the two lifestage transitions.  Unfortunately, I wasted a lot of time trying to analyze the above and have become a bit stuck!*


#### HOIs arrising from mechanistic resource competition models

Unlike the phenomenological model above, we can also imagine HOIs emerging from mechanistic models. 

Because experimental data evaluating HOIs at the demographic level is lacking, we developed a mechanistic simulation of annual plant competition for a single shared resource. We then try and describe competition in the system using a simple phenomenological competition model.

#### Resource mechanistic model

Our mechanistic model is inspired by California annual plant communities growing in a Mediterranean climate.  In this environment, rainfall starts in the winter and gradually declines through the spring while temperature and evaporative demand increases.  Plants germinate in the winter and begin to flower in spring.  By summer, most plants have completed flowering and produce seeds and die.  Our resource model tracks a single pool of generic soil resources, possibly water or perhaps mobile inorganic nutrients.  The resource supply rate spikes in early spring and then goes to zero as the spring progresses.  Thus the pool of resources is exemplified by non-equilibrium pulse dyanmics and never reaches an equilibrium.  

In our model, rates of plant growth depend on resource availability. As spring progresses, plants grow larger but resource supply diminishes.  Eventually plants reach a point where their resource uptake rate cannot keep up with respiration and maintanence costs.  At this point, we assume that plants have evolved a development switch of some kind that allows them to convert their biomass into seed mass. At this point the adult plants die and stop taking up resources.  

The model is expressed as a set of coupled differential equations, 

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq4}
\begin{split}
\frac{dR}{dt} = S(t) - \epsilon R - \sum_{i = 1}^nB_{i}f(R,r, K)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where $R(t)$ gives the resource availability at time $t$, $S$ gives the resource supply rate and $\epsilon$ gives the abiotic loss of resources to evaporation and leaching. The final term expresses the loss of resources due to uptake by the annual plants.  We sum over each of the $n$ species in the community. Annual plant biomass of species $i$ at time $t$ is given by $B$ and the uptake rate is a function $f_i$ of total resource availability.

Growth of each species depends on resource availabilty,  

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq5}
\begin{split}
\frac{dB_{i}}{dt} = B_{i}(qf_i(R) - m)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Where, $B_i$ is the total biomass of species $i$, $q$ is a resource conversion factor, $m$ is a per biomass respiration and tissue loss rate, and as in the first equation, $f_i$ is the resource uptake rate.  

In this model, the growth of each species stops when $qf_i(R) = m$ meaning that biomass gained is equal to biomass lost to respiration and maintanence.  Tat this point, the optimal behavior of the plant is to stop trying to grow, convert stored resources to seed mass and then senesce. We impose this behavior on the model by setting biomass at time $z$ ($B(z)$) to zero when $m$ matches resource uptake and conversion: $qf_i(R(z)) = m$. 

So far we have described a model run in continuous time within a single generation. For this model we denoted rates of change of biomass and resources within the season in terms of very small time intervals $t$. By contrast, we keep track of total population size of each generation at a discrete annual time scale $\tau$.  To calculate the total population size of each species at time step $tau+1$ we take each species' maximum vegetative biomass during the growing season, multiply that by a conversion factor $c$ to get a seed mass, and then multiply that by a constant seed per gram ratio, $\mu$.  Thus,     

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq6}
\begin{split}
N_{i,\tau+1} = \mu c(\max B_i)_{\tau}
\end{split}
\end{equation}

Finally different species are likely to have different rates of resource uptake.  For purposes of illustration we assume some kind of trade-off between rate of resource uptake at high resource availability and rate of resource uptake at low resource availability. This means that species which dominate early in the season when resource availability is high will also flower and stop growing earlier in the growing season. In contrast, species that grow slower early in the growing season are able to persist later into the season when resource availability is low. 

We enforce this trade-off between species by giving each species $i$ a unique resource uptake function $f_i$ that depends on two species specific parameters $r_i$ and $K_i$, 

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq7}
\begin{split}
f_i(R, r_i, K_i) = r_iR/(K_i + R)
\end{split}
\end{equation}

In our simulation we ran a three species community with the three species exhibiting the resource uptake dynamics shown in figure . 


This leads to a 

#### Phenomenological annual plant model 

Annual plant demography and competition can be modeled using a system of difference equations relating annual plant density in year $t$ to density in year $t+1$, 

\vspace{-4em}
\begin{equation} \label{eq1}
\begin{split}
n_{1,t+1} = n_{1,t}\lambda_i (1 + \alpha_{1,1}n_{1,t} + \alpha_{1,2}n_{2,t} + \alpha_{1,3}n_{3,t})^{\tau_1}, 
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $\tau_{i} < 0$, $\lambda_i > 1$, and the entries in the competition matrix $\alpha_{ij} > 0$. $\lambda_i$ denotes maximum per capita reproductive output. $\tau_i$ is a species specific parameter controling the how steep fecundity declines with competition.  To simplify the model, we assume all adult plants die (i.e. are annuals) and we assume that all seeds germinate. Such a phenomenological model has been widely used to model annual plant communities [@kraft_plant_2015].  In this example we consider competition between three species denoted with the subscripts on each parameter.
