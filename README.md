## Computer Code for "Mechanisms underlying higher order interactions: from definitions to ecological processes"

This directory contains all R scripts necessary to run the simulations and analyses and generate the figures presented in the manuscript. 

### Reproducing analyses 

The 'code' directory contains all the R scripts. To recreate the analyses in the manuscript open an R session and set the working directory to this folder  containing this README file.  Then run the "run_all_scripts.R" script. **Note: running all analyses may take 15 to 20 minutes to complete.**

### File details 

1. simulation_functions.R

  Stores the growth and resource functions that are used by the ordinary differential equation solver to model resource competition.  

2. plotting_parameters.R

  Stores the graphical parameters used throughout for plotting figures. 
  
3. make_figure_two.R

  Generate figure two in the main text. 

4. run_simulations.R

  Iterate through all the combinations of competitor density explored in the main text. Defines all parameter values used in the simulations in the main text. 

5. fit_models.R 

  Fit the phenomenological competition models to the simulated experimental data generated by the run_simulations.R script. Generate figure 3, 4, and 5 in the main text. Generate figures S1 and S2 in the supporting information. 
  
6. make_figure_6.R 

  Generate figure six in the main text. 
  
7. vary_tradeoff.R

  Run simulations and analyses for appendix A "The effect of relative non-linearity in resource uptake curves on higher order interactions".  Generate figure A1 and table A1 in Appendix A. 

8. run_all_scripts.R

  Make a figures and output folder in the working directory and run all the scripts in the order above.
